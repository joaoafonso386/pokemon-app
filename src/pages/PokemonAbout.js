            PokÃ©mon was invented by a Japanese man named Satoshi Tajiri and his
            friend Ken Sugimori, who is an illustrator. Back in 1982 Satoshi
            started a gaming magazine together with his friends called Game
            Freak, but after a while he decided to start making his own video
            games, instead of writing about them.
